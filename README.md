# Paper-rock-scissors
A plain simple Paper Rock Scissors game on javascript (Console only though)
As I re-readed the page on the Odin Project I Noticed it is supposed to return the result in a string, like not printing it on a prompt or in the console, but I liked this one that is fully functional so I'll leave it here and will do another that does like the OTP says.

What did I Learn?

-How to ask the user for Input via prompt() and save it in a variable
-Use loops to execute code multiple times
-Make a loop that can iterates inside itself if needed
-Call function, and make them return specific values or strings
-Work with arrays in a very basic level
